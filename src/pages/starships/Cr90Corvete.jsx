  const description = `The CR90 corvette, also known as the Corellian corvette or Rebel blockade runner, is a versatile starship widely used throughout the *Star Wars* galaxy. Built by the Corellian Engineering Corporation, it became famous for its speed, adaptability, and reliability. Measuring about 150 meters in length, the CR90 was often employed for diplomatic missions, cargo transport, and escort duties, but it was also heavily modified for combat by the Rebel Alliance. Armed with laser turrets and equipped with powerful engines, it was capable of outrunning larger Imperial ships, making it ideal for hit-and-run tactics and supply runs. The most iconic CR90 corvette is the *Tantive IV*, the personal consular ship of Senator Bail Organa and later Princess Leia Organa. It was aboard this vessel that Leia carried the stolen Death Star plans, leading directly into the events of *A New Hope*. The CR90 symbolizes defiance, resilience, and the ingenuity of the Rebellion.
